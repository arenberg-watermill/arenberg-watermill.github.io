<h1 align="center">Hi üëã</h1>
<h3 align="center">üè° Welcome to the offical page of the Arenberg Watermill. Look around!</h3>

In September 2020, the historical Arenberg Watermill was restored in its full glory. This website is the result of a thesis investigation performed by engineering student Tibo Geenen, towards the feasibility of green energy generation by the watermill. It shows [real-time data](https://arenberg-watermill.github.io/real-time-data/) and provides an in-depth look into why it will unfortunately not be able to contribute to the production of renewable electricity.
 
If you would like to know more about the history of the watermill, there are a few sources provided by the KU Leuven (in Dutch). Firstly an [article](https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/nl/2017/toen-nu-watermolen-arenberg) before the restauration, then the [campain page](https://www.kuleuven.be/fondsenwerving/overons/erfgoed/watermolen/geschiedenis) to raise funds and lastly an [article](https://stories.kuleuven.be/nl/verhalen/watermolen-aan-arenbergkasteel-in-ere-hersteld) after installation of the restored mills (also in [English](https://stories.kuleuven.be/en/stories/iconic-watermill-at-the-arenberg-castle-restored-to-place-of-honour)). Extra footage can be found [here](https://www.kuleuven.be/fondsenwerving/overons/erfgoed/watermolen/wandelingen-langs-de-watermolen) or on the YouTube channel or Wikipedia page.

The mill is located on KU Leuven campus grounds, right next to the stunning Arenberg Castle. The exact location is shown on the map below.
