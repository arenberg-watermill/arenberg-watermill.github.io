The data showed below is provided by the VMM (Vlaamse Milieu Maatschappij) and shows the water level at station "Uitlaatkunstwerk Egenhoven". The data is used to build the model to predict the rotational speed of the watermills based on the water level of the river, see more [here](https://arenberg-watermill.github.io/rpm-model/).

The water level is being measured by (elaborate working principle distance sensor...TODO) and monitored by the VMM.

The VMM itself uses the data to prevent the city of Leuven from being flooded. When a water level of 23.5 mTAW (distance in meters above sea level) is reached, a pneumatic valve is activated which gradually raises an underwater gate along with the water level. That way, a flood area (instead of the city downstream) gradually fills up with water.

The monitoring system can be accessed locally, but also through an online app. The valves can be controlled locally too with the dials underneath the screen.
