The RPM data shown on this page is real-time and updates every single time a new measurement is detected. It is measured by a custom-made module and includes a local visual representation of the data as well. More information about the module can be found [here](https://arenberg-watermill.github.io/measure-module/). If the mill is standing still it will appear as if there are no updates. However, the final Interval block keeps track of the zero values.
