### Why was this made?

Originally, the subject of this thesis was to investigate the economic feasibility of power production by the watermill. After measuring the actual power capabilities and looking into relevant literature, it soon became clear that this project can most likely never be achieved in a financially responsible manner with the current setup. To give the site the recognition it deserves, this website was built as a didactic work for other students or interested parties looking to find information on the workings of the watermill, along with [real-time data](https://arenberg-watermill.github.io/real-time-data/). If you happen to come across this site without knowing what the watermill looks like, you can find pictures below!
