This is the base for the future website showing the real-time statistics on the Arenberg Watermill. In the future, it will show [real-time data](https://tibogeenen.be/real-time-data/) like power and rotational speed, along with the possible mechanical energy it produced since December 2021.

Why was this made?
======
Originally, the subject of my thesis was looking at the economic feasibility of power production by the watermill. After measuring the actual power capabilities, it soon became clear that this project is not feasible at all. Instead, the focus was shifted to a didactic work for other students looking to find information on the workings of the watermill, along with real time information. If you happen to come across this site without knowing what the watermill looks like, you can find a picture below!
