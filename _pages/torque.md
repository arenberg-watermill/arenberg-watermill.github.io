Torque/speed curves can be characterised so the torque cruves are known for every no-load speed measured.

# Prony brake

A Prony brake is installed to perform torque measuring tests with so the torque/speed curves can be found.

# Curves

The measured curves are quadratic and show all the torques at different load speeds starting at a single no-load speed. Because the summer of 2022 was the driest ever recorded in Belgium, it was only possible to characterise two different curves.
