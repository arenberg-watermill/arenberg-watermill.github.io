This is the base for the future website showing the real-time statistics on the Arenberg Water Mill. In the future, it will show the real-time power and rotational speed, along with the possible mechanical energy it produced since December 2021.

Why was this made?
======
Originally, the subject of my thesis was looking at the economic feasibility of power production by the water mill. After measuring the actual power capabilities, it soon became clear that this project is not feasible at all. Instead, the focus was shifted to a didactic work for other students looking to find information on the workings of the water mill, along with real time information. If you happen to come across this site without knowing what the water mill looks like, you can find a picture below!
