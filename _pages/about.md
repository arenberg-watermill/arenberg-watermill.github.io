<h1 align="center">Hi üëã</h1>
<h3 align="center">üè° Welcome to the offical page of the Arenberg Watermill. Look around!

In September 2020, the historical Arenberg Watermill was restored in its full glory. This website is the result of an investigation towards the feasibility of green energy generation. It shows [real-time data](https://arenberg-watermill.github.io/real-time-data/) and provides an in-depth look into why it will unfortunately not be able to contribute to the production of electricity.
 
If you would like to know more about the history of the watermill, there are a few sources provided by the KU Leuven (in Dutch). Firstly an [article](https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/nl/2017/toen-nu-watermolen-arenberg) before the restauration, then the [campain page](https://www.kuleuven.be/fondsenwerving/overons/erfgoed/watermolen/geschiedenis) to raise funds and lastly an [article](https://stories.kuleuven.be/nl/verhalen/watermolen-aan-arenbergkasteel-in-ere-hersteld) after installation of the restored mills (also in [English](https://stories.kuleuven.be/en/stories/iconic-watermill-at-the-arenberg-castle-restored-to-place-of-honour). Extra footage can be found [here](https://www.kuleuven.be/fondsenwerving/overons/erfgoed/watermolen/wandelingen-langs-de-watermolen).
